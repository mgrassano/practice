Write a function that takes an array of decimals ("prices") as an argument and returns an array of integers with length 2 (index of best buy, sell points).
The first integer should represent the index within the argument array at which point one should buy to maximize profit.
The second integer should represent the index within the argument array at which point one should sell to maximize profit.
You cannot sell before you buy.  That is to say, ensure your first index returned is greater than your second.
Include tests.
